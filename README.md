**Program Details data**<br/>
**Creating Visualizations and Dashboards with Cognos Analytics** <br/>
In the first part of the final assignment, you will use provided sample data to create some visualizations using Excel for the web. In the second part of the final assignment, you will create some visualizations and add them to a dashboard using Cognos Analytics. The program consists of 9 online courses learning the core principles of data analysis and gaining hands-on skills practice. Youâ€™ll work with a variety of data sources, project scenarios, and data analysis tools, including Excel, SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Cognos Analytics, gaining practical experience with data manipulation and applying analytical techniques.

**Capstone Project**<br/>
You will undertake the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard. The project will culminate with a presentation of your data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization. <br/>
